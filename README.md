# Robotics
MATLAB implementation of different robots along with the simulation environment CoppeliaSim.



There are different tasks that were done.

1. Swedish wheel robot and inverse kinematics
2. Image processing of a camera on a robot and following a leader robot using the same. This also included a small task programming a robot that uses ultrasonic sensor and so that it doesn't collide with the obstacles.
3. Designing a primitive Kalman Filter and using encoder and GPS values to exactly locate the robot
